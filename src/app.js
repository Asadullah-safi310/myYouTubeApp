   and then go to the user.controller.js file to run the registerUser function 
*/


//? app.use("/api/v1/users", userRouter); 
// this means that all the routes in the userRouter will be prefixed with /api/v1/users, it works as parent route
// so if you have a route in userRouter like /login, it will be accessible at /api/v1/users/login
// if you have a route in userRouter like /profile, it will be accessible at /api/v1/users/profile
// so the userRouter is the child route and the /api/v1/users is the parent route
// this is a good practice to keep the routes organized and easy to manage
